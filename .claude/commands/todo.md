## 🔧 Implementation

When this command is invoked:

### Simple Text Input Support

The command now accepts simple text input that gets automatically formatted:

```bash
# Simple text input - automatically formatted by Claude
/todo claude-context investigation
/todo fix critical bug in auth
/todo update documentation tomorrow

# Claude will detect keywords and auto-format as:
# - Priority: high/medium/low (based on keywords like "critical", "bug", "urgent")
# - Due dates: "tomorrow", "next week", "urgent" etc.
# - Proper task ID assignment
```

### Auto-Formatting Rules

Claude will analyze simple text input and:

- **Detect priority** from keywords (critical/urgent/bug = high, feature/improvement = medium, docs/cleanup = low)
- **Parse dates** from natural language ("tomorrow", "next week", "urgent")
- **Assign unique task ID** by finding next available number
- **Format properly** for todos.md structure

1. **Locate Project Root**

   - Look for: `.git`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.
   - Default to current directory if no markers found

2. **File Management**

   - Create/locate `todos.md` in project root
   - Ensure proper markdown structure
   - Maintain backup in `.claude/backups/todos.md.backup`

3. **Task Format**

   ```markdown
   # Project Todos

   ## 🔥 High Priority

   - [ ] Critical bug fix | Due: 12-18-2024 3:00 PM | #1
   - [ ] Security patch | Due: 12-18-2024 | #2

   ## 🟡 Medium Priority

   - [ ] Implement new feature | Due: 12-20-2024 | #3
   - [ ] Code review | #4

   ## 🟢 Low Priority

   - [ ] Update documentation | Due: 12-25-2024 | #5

   - [x] Create API | Due: 12-14-2024 | Done: 12-14-2024 | #8
   ```

4. **Smart Sorting**

   - Within each priority level, sort by due date
   - Tasks with due dates appear before those without
   - Overdue tasks highlighted with 🚨

5. **Date Parsing**

   - Natural language: "tomorrow", "next week", "in 3 days"
   - Specific dates: "12-25-2024", "Dec 25", "Christmas"
   - Times: "3pm", "15:00", "tomorrow 2pm"
   - Relative: "in 2 hours", "+3d", "next Monday"

6. **Display Format**
   When listing tasks, show:

   ```
   📝 Active Tasks (6)

   🔥 HIGH PRIORITY
   1. [🚨 OVERDUE] Critical bug fix - Due: Yesterday 3:00 PM
   2. Security patch - Due: Today

   🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY
   3. Implement new feature - Due: Tomorrow
   4. Code review - No due date

   6. Refactor old code - No due date

## 🔒 Best Practices

1. **Use priorities** to organize work
2. **Set due dates** for time-sensitive tasks
3. **Complete tasks** instead of removing them
4. **Review overdue** tasks daily
5. **Archive completed** tasks monthly
6. **Use tags** like #bug, #feature, @person
7. **Keep descriptions** concise but clear

## 📝 Example Workflow

```bash
# Monday morning
/todo past due              # Check overdue
/todo today                 # Plan the day
/todo add "Team standup" today 10am

# During work
/todo next                  # Get next task
/todo complete 1            # Mark as done
/todo add "Fix found bug" high

# End of day
/todo complete 2,3,4        # Finish tasks
/todo add "Continue tomorrow" tomorrow
/todo stats                 # Review progress
```
